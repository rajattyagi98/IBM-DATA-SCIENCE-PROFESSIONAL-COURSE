    "\n",
    "1. **Python:** Widely adopted for its versatility and extensive ecosystem, Python is a go-to language for data science tasks. It offers powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R:** Specifically designed for statistical computing and data analysis, R is favored by statisticians and data scientists alike. It provides a rich set of packages for statistical modeling, visualization, and exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL:** While not a programming language in the traditional sense, SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with relational databases. Data scientists frequently use SQL to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data stored in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Julia:** Known for its high-performance computing capabilities, Julia is gaining popularity in data science for tasks that require intensive numerical and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scala:** Often used in combination with Apache Spark, Scala is a programming language that facilitates distributed computing, making it suitable for big data processing and analytics.\n"
